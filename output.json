I wished that he could have a video to layout the course at the beginning of the course to make it easier to understand the structure. And also some material can be slow down so I can see what is being type (maybe I am getting old). By paying attention to the detail of what he say, you can tell he have been in the field, and come across a lot of experience, and what he present inside the training is an accumulation of his experiences. It will save a lot of headache for the newcomer. Thank you, Chris for taking the time to do this training.\n\nAlso, the version might be a slightly older version, so there is a slight tweak that you have to do. The Q&A session is helpful to go through, also check out the Appendix session, it is useful as well.",

I wished that he could have a video to layout the course at the beginning of the course to make it easier to understand the structure. And also some material can be slow down so I can see what is being type (maybe I am getting old). By paying attention to the detail of what he say, you can tell he have been in the field, and come across a lot of experience, and what he present inside the training is an accumulation of his experiences. It will save a lot of headache for the newcomer. Thank you, Chris for taking the time to do this training.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the version might be a slightly older version, so there is a slight tweak that you have to do. The Q&A session is helpful to go through, also check out the Appendix session, it is useful as well.</p>"

The content was communicated in an understandable way, obviously intended for an audience who already have experience with linux and advanced systems administration, and no time was wasted in efforts to engage the audience with extraneous information. \n\nThe course was very step-wise, and dense in information - I found myself pausing the video often in order to keep up with my note-taking, which is exactly what I hope for - no wasted time, lots of useful information.\n\nI hope than any future courses I take from udemy will use this same presenter, or a presenter with a similar teaching style.",

The content was communicated in an understandable way, obviously intended for an audience who already have experience with linux and advanced systems administration, and no time was wasted in efforts to engage the audience with extraneous information. </p>\n\n<p>The course was very step-wise, and dense in information - I found myself pausing the video often in order to keep up with my note-taking, which is exactly what I hope for - no wasted time, lots of useful information.</p>\n\n<p>I hope than any future courses I take from udemy will use this same presenter, or a presenter with a similar teaching style.</p>"

And I couldn't have done it without you.\n\nSome things are not as elegant as I would like.  For example, I know there is a better way to iterate through a series of files and run the replace module multiple times per file.  But what I wrote works.  \n\nI have many years experience as a UNIX/Linux Systems Administrator.  In some ways, I'm kind of old school, but I just love learning new tricks!!\n\nThanks, Chris!",

It seems reviewers have a tendency to be too easy with their high praise.  Having said that, this is an excellent course and it is well worth the money.\n\nThe presenter knows his subject matter very well. He communicates clearly. The material is very well organized. The presentation is polished.\nThis course is everything I had hoped it would be. I am proficient in the basics with just a week of work which is no small accomplishment and due in part to this course.  On a side note, I really appreciated the setup information and downloads to get docker up and running. I also liked the instructor's choice of editor, Atom. These little gems are not only of value to me personally, but they show off the instructor's experience not just of this technology but of development work in general.",

I know a trainer cannot be expected to explain all the steps for all students possible starting points and computer systems, linux, mac, windows, etc. but at the very least he should give better instructions to set up an environment with Docker like the trainer actually configured for his own machine in his lectures.  The appendix instructions on Docker are cryptic and vague.  They should be clearer on what to expect during install and the very basics of how docker works would be nice.  For example, we don't actually need to download Unbuntu iso images manually, the Docker setup does that for us.  What happens after the install completes? We should have been warned the Docker VM will just hang after completion but the containers are up and running and thats the EXPECTED outcome... How do we get ssh working for our docker containers? etc, etc.  Its true, some of these questions are answered in the QandA but you have to hunt through each lectures QandA to find them.  Why not put that information in the environment configuration steps? Most importantly, he completely skips the explanation of how he configured the NFS with Docker containers like he has in his environment for the lectures. (Which it actually never was NFS. I was informed it was an additional flag added to the Docker exec command so it just looks like an NFS file share in the lessons)  Why not show the terminal command somewhere so we can do it instead of making us ask for it!? I spent over 4+ hours attempting initial setup on a Mac like the instructor has using both Docker and Vagrant and I still don't have it working properly.
