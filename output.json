I wished that he could have a video to layout the course at the beginning of the course to make it easier to understand the structure. And also some material can be slow down so I can see what is being type (maybe I am getting old). By paying attention to the detail of what he say, you can tell he have been in the field, and come across a lot of experience, and what he present inside the training is an accumulation of his experiences. It will save a lot of headache for the newcomer. Thank you, Chris for taking the time to do this training.\n\nAlso, the version might be a slightly older version, so there is a slight tweak that you have to do. The Q&A session is helpful to go through, also check out the Appendix session, it is useful as well.",

I wished that he could have a video to layout the course at the beginning of the course to make it easier to understand the structure. And also some material can be slow down so I can see what is being type (maybe I am getting old). By paying attention to the detail of what he say, you can tell he have been in the field, and come across a lot of experience, and what he present inside the training is an accumulation of his experiences. It will save a lot of headache for the newcomer. Thank you, Chris for taking the time to do this training.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the version might be a slightly older version, so there is a slight tweak that you have to do. The Q&A session is helpful to go through, also check out the Appendix session, it is useful as well.</p>"

And I couldn't have done it without you.\n\nSome things are not as elegant as I would like.  For example, I know there is a better way to iterate through a series of files and run the replace module multiple times per file.  But what I wrote works.  \n\nI have many years experience as a UNIX/Linux Systems Administrator.  In some ways, I'm kind of old school, but I just love learning new tricks!!\n\nThanks, Chris!",

For example, I know there is a better way to iterate through a series of files and run the replace module multiple times per file.

The presentation is polished.\nThis course is everything I had hoped it would be. I am proficient in the basics with just a week of work which is no small accomplishment and due in part to this course.  On a side note, I really appreciated the setup information and downloads to get docker up and running. I also liked the instructor's choice of editor, Atom. These little gems are not only of value to me personally, but they show off the instructor's experience not just of this technology but of development work in general.",

Having said that, this is an excellent course and it is well worth the money.</p>\n\n<p>The presenter knows his subject matter very well. He communicates clearly. The material is very well organized. The presentation is polished.<br />This course is everything I had hoped it would be. I am proficient in the basics with just a week of work which is no small accomplishment and due in part to this course.  On a side note, I really appreciated the setup information and downloads to get docker up and running. I also liked the instructor's choice of editor, Atom. These little gems are not only of value to me personally, but they show off the instructor's experience not just of this technology but of development work in general.</p>"

Just listening someone explaining is quite hard to understand, specially when you are not an expert in the subject. Secondly, videos should be self-contained. This course has many videos and the instructor cannot expect that everyone is going to watch all classes at once. If one watch a video a day, it is quite hard to follow because there is a need to remember exactly what has been done in the last 3 or 4 videos. Thirdly, the instructor overlooked some fundamental configuration (e.g., access keys for ssh) for getting started with ansible.

I've bought books, watched free youtube tutorials, scoured stackexhange, and read documentation until my eyes bled.\n\nChris has managed to put together an engaging course that covers all the basics and more while setting up a real-world scenario lab from beginning to end. It's obvious he spent a lot of time putting together the material as each new concept introduced has an explicit purpose to forwarding the lab.\n\nEven though this is a beginners course, I highly recommend going over the Ansible documentation and looking at a few example playbooks before starting this course to familiarize yourself with some of the concepts.\n\nAlso, Chris is running Ansible 1.9. The current release is 2.1. You will run into issues/errors if you install the current version. GitHub is your friend for work arounds. It's annoying to stop and troubleshoot when the behavior you get does not match Chris', but you will learn even more about Ansible reading through the issues at GitHub than just following along with Chris.\n\n*Quick tip, for sudo timeout issues, set the %sudo group in the sudoers file on the app devices to NOPASSWD:ALL. This was the biggest issue a ran into running Ansible 2.1.",

It's obvious he spent a lot of time putting together the material as each new concept introduced has an explicit purpose to forwarding the lab.</p>\n\n<p>Even though this is a beginners course, I highly recommend going over the Ansible documentation and looking at a few example playbooks before starting this course to familiarize yourself with some of the concepts.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Chris is running Ansible 1.9. The current release is 2.1. You will run into issues/errors if you install the current version. GitHub is your friend for work arounds. It's annoying to stop and troubleshoot when the behavior you get does not match Chris', but you will learn even more about Ansible reading through the issues at GitHub than just following along with Chris.</p>\n\n<p>*Quick tip, for sudo timeout issues, set the %sudo group in the sudoers file on the app devices to NOPASSWD:ALL. This was the biggest issue a ran into running Ansible 2.1.</p>"

The scrips to set up the work environment and follow along are also provided as a resource and they are very basic and easy to understand.\n\nThe instructor is very knowledgeable, the course is fast paced, but well laid out, easy to understand, full of quality information and riddled with tips from the instructor's experience and where to find more information related to the subjects presented.\n\nOverall I'd say, this is an excellent course for anyone wishing to learn Ansible.",

The scrips to set up the work environment and follow along are also provided as a resource and they are very basic and easy to understand.</p>\n\n<p>The instructor is very knowledgeable, the course is fast paced, but well laid out, easy to understand, full of quality information and riddled with tips from the instructor's experience and where to find more information related to the subjects presented.</p>\n\n<p>Overall I'd say, this is an excellent course for anyone wishing to learn Ansible.</p>"

I was informed it was an additional flag added to the Docker exec command so it just looks like an NFS file share in the lessons)  Why not show the terminal command somewhere so we can do it instead of making us ask for it!?
